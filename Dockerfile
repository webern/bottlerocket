# The experimental cache mount type doesn't expand arguments, so our choices are limited.
# We can either reuse the same cache for all builds, which triggers overlayfs errors if
# the builds run in parallel, or we can use a new cache for each build, which defeats the
# purpose. We work around the limitation by materializing a per-build stage that can be
# used as the source of the cache.

# Some builds need to modify files in the source directory, for example Rust
# software using build.rs to generate code.  The source directory is mounted in
# using "--mount=source" which is owned by root, and we need to modify it as
# the builder user.  To get around this, we can use a "cache" mount, which we
# just won't share or reuse.  We mount a cache into the location we need to
# change, and in some cases, set up symlinks so that it looks like a normal
# part of the source tree.  (This is like a tmpfs mount, but cache mounts have
# more flexibility - you can specify a source to set them up beforehand,
# specify uid/gid, etc.)  This cache is also variant-specific (in addition to
# package and arch, like the one above) for cases where we need to build
# differently per variant; the cache will be empty if you change
# BUILDSYS_VARIANT.
